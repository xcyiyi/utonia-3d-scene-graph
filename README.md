# Utonia 3D Detection Project

This repository contains a custom SUN RGB-D 3D detector built on the Utonia encoder. See [the detector summary](README_DETECTOR.md) for the implemented model and final A/B/C validation results. The 3D scene graph model discussed for 3DSSG has not yet been implemented.

## Upstream Utonia

**TL;DR:** This repo provide cross-domain pre-trained [Point Transformer V3](https://github.com/Pointcept/PointTransformerV3) for 3D point cloud downstream tasks, modified from [Sonata](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sonata.git) and [Concerto](https://pointcept.github.io/Concerto/).

The original [Pointcept/Utonia](https://github.com/Pointcept/Utonia) repository is the official project repository of the paper **_Utonia: Toward One Encoder for All Point Clouds_**. Its encoder source and inference demos are included here under the upstream license. For the original pre-training process, see [Pointcept](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept).

## Installation
This repo provide two ways of installation: **standalone mode** and **package mode**. And thanks to [HubertLongshanks](https://github.com/HubertLongshanks), there are some docker images, [utonia-cuda128](https://hub.docker.com/r/hughbertlong/utonia-cuda-128-rtx-blackwell) and [utonia-cuda128-flashattn](https://hub.docker.com/r/hughbertlong/utonia-cu128-x86-ubuntu24.04-flashattn), as in [#28](https://github.com/Pointcept/Utonia/issues/28).
- The **standalone mode** is recommended for users who want to use the code for quick inference and visualization. We provide a most easy way to install the environment by using `conda` environment file. The whole environment including `cuda` and `pytorch` can be easily installed by running the following command:
  ```bash
  # Create and activate conda environment named as 'utonia'
  # cuda: 12.4, pytorch: 2.5.0

  # run `unset CUDA_PATH` if you have installed cuda in your local environment
  conda env create -f environment.yml --verbose
  conda activate utonia
  ```

  *Make sure **FlashAttention** is installed by default.*

- The **package mode** is recommended for users who want to inject our model into their own codebase. We provide a `setup.py` file for installation. You can install the package by running the following command:
  ```bash
  # Ensure Cuda and Pytorch are already installed in your local environment

  # CUDA_VERSION: cuda version of local environment (e.g., 124), check by running 'nvcc --version'
  # TORCH_VERSION: torch version of local environment (e.g., 2.5.0), check by running 'python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"'
  pip install spconv-cu${CUDA_VERSION}
  pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{TORCH_VERSION}+cu${CUDA_VERSION}.html
  pip install git+https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git
  pip install huggingface_hub timm 

  # (optional, or directly copy the utonia folder to your project)
  python setup.py install
  ```
  Additionally, for running our **demo code**, the following packages are also required:
  ```bash
  pip install open3d fast_pytorch_kmeans psutil addict scipy camtools natsort opencv-python trimesh gradio numpy==1.26.4  # currently, open3d does not support numpy 2.x
  ```

## Quick Start
***Let's first begin with some simple visualization demo with Utonia, our pre-trained PTv3 model:***
- **Visualization.** We provide the same visualization demos as Sonata and Concerto: the segmentation result, similarity heatmap, and PCA visualization demo in the `demo` folder, including the visualization without color/normal input and the demo for videos lifted by [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt.git). You can run the following command to visualize the result of `utonia`:
  ```bash
  # For visualization demo without color and normal, use python demo/xxx.py --wo_color --wo_normal
  export PYTHONPATH=./
  python demo/0_pca_indoor.py
  python demo/1_similarity.py
  python demo/2_sem_seg.py  # linear probed head on ScanNet
  python demo/3_batch_forward.py
  python demo/4_pca_hk.py
  python demo/5_pca_manipulation.py
  python demo/6_pca_object.py
  python demo/7_pca_outdoor.py
  ```

  <div align='left'>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pointcept/assets/main/utonia/demo.png" alt="teaser" width="800" />
  </div>

  For video demo, we need VGGT to lift video to point cloud. The additional installation for VGGT is as below:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt.git
  cd vggt
  pip install -e .
  cd ..
  # Or you can copy the vggt folder in the vggt repository to ./demo
  # Then you can run the demo
  python demo/8_pca_video.py \
  --input_video ${YOUR_VIDEO_PATH} \
  --conf_thres 0 \
  --prediction_mode "Depthmap and Camera Branch" \
  --if_TSDF \
  --pca_start 1 \
  --pca_brightness 1.2 # the usage of these inpputs can be found in 'help'.
  ```

***Then, here are the instruction to run inference on custom data with our Utonia:***

- **Data.** Organize your data in a dictionary with the following format:
  ```python
  # single point cloud
  point = {
    "coord": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "color": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "normal": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "segment": numpy.array,  # (N,) optional
  }

  # batched point clouds

  # check the data structure of batched point clouds from here:
  # https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept#offset
  point = {
    "coord": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "color": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "normal": numpy.array,  # (N, 3)
    "batch": numpy.array,  # (N,) optional
    "segment": numpy.array,  # (N,) optional
  }
  ```
  One example of the data can be loaded by running the following command:
  ```python
  point = utonia.data.load("sample1")
  ```
- **Transform.** The data transform pipeline is different from previous Sonata and Concerto. You can use the following code to construct the transform pipeline:
  ```python
  # The choice of scale depends on the desired level of granularity. You may need to fine-tune this parameter to find the optimal value for your specific tasks. Generally, the larger the scale, the more fine-grained the results will be.
  config = [
      # dict(type="NormalizeCoord"), # uncomment when applying to objects
      dict(type="RandomScale", scale=[scale, scale]),
      dict(type="CenterShift", apply_z=True), # remove this for outdoor LiDAR and ensure the ego-vehicle is at the origin (0, 0, 0), with the road plane aligned with the xy-plane
      dict(
          type="GridSample",
          grid_size=0.01,
          hash_type="fnv",
          mode="train",
          return_grid_coord=True,
          return_inverse=True,
      ),
      dict(type="NormalizeColor"),
      dict(type="ToTensor"),
      dict(
          type="Collect",
          keys=("coord", "grid_coord", "color", "inverse"),
          feat_keys=("coord", "color", "normal"),
      ),
  ]
  transform = utonia.transform.Compose(config)
  ```
  The above default inference augmentation pipeline can also be acquired by running the following command:
  ```python
  # apply_z_positive = False when applying to outdoor data to ensure the road is on xy-plane, normalize_coord = True when applying to the single object
  transform = utonia.transform.default(scale = scale, apply_z_positive = True, normalize_coord = False)
  ```
- **Model.** Load the pre-trained model by running the following command:
  ```python
  # Load the pre-trained model from Huggingface
  # When color or normal is absent, please apply default zeros to the missing modality
  # ckpt is cached in ~/.cache/utonia/ckpt, and the path can be customized by setting 'download_root'
  model = utonia.model.load("utonia", repo_id="Pointcept/Utonia").cuda()

  # or
  from utonia.model import PointTransformerV3
  model = PointTransformerV3.from_pretrained("Pointcept/Utonia").cuda()

  # Load the pre-trained model from local path
  # assume the ckpt file is stored in the 'ckpt' folder
  model = utonia.model.load("ckpt/utonia.pth").cuda()

  # the ckpt file store the config and state_dict of pretrained model
  ```

- **Inference.** Run the inference by running the following command:
  ```python
  point = transform(point)
  for key in point.keys():
      if isinstance(point[key], torch.Tensor):
          point[key] = point[key].cuda(non_blocking=True)
  point = model(point)
  ```
  As Utonia is a pre-trained **encoder-only** PTv3, the default output of the model is point cloud after hierarchical encoding. The encoded point feature can be mapping back to original scale with the following code:
  ```python
  # use range(4) to concatenate the features from all the upcast layers, here we use range 2 for visualization
  for _ in range(2):
      assert "pooling_parent" in point.keys()
      assert "pooling_inverse" in point.keys()
      parent = point.pop("pooling_parent")
      inverse = point.pop("pooling_inverse")
      parent.feat = torch.cat([parent.feat, point.feat[inverse]], dim=-1)
      point = parent
  while "pooling_parent" in point.keys():
      assert "pooling_inverse" in point.keys()
      parent = point.pop("pooling_parent")
      inverse = point.pop("pooling_inverse")
      parent.feat = point.feat[inverse]
      point = parent
  ```
  Yet during data transformation, we operate `GridSampling` which makes the number of points feed into the network mismatch with the original point cloud. Using the following code to further map the feature back to the original point cloud:
  ```python
  feat = point.feat[point.inverse]
  ```
